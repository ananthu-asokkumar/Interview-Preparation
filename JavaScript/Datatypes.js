/**
 * Primitive Datatypes:In javascript primitive is a data that is not an object and has no methods .
 * There are 7 primitive data types: string, number, bigint, boolean, undefined, symbol, and null.
 *
 *
 * All primitives are immutable, i.e., they cannot be altered. It is important not to confuse a primitive itself with a
 * variable assigned a primitive value. The variable may be reassigned a new value, but the existing value can not be 
 * changed in the ways that objects, arrays, and functions can be altered.
 * 
 * Abstract datatypes
 * 1) objects
 * 2)arrays
 * 3)Sets
 * 4)Maps
