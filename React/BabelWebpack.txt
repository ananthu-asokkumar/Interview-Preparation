BABEL


Babel is a JavaScript compiler and transpiler


Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards
 compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. 
 Here are the main things Babel can do for you:

*Transform syntax
*Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment (through a third-party polyfill such as core-js)
*Source code transformations (codemods)


Babel can convert JSX syntax! Check out our React preset to get started. Use it together with the babel-sublime
 package to bring syntax highlighting to a whole new level.

You can install this preset with

npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-react
